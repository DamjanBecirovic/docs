# Pipeline YAML Reference

This document is the reference for the YAML grammar used for describing the pipelines of Semaphore 2.0.

The core properties of a Semaphore 2.0 pipeline configuration file are `blocks`, which appear only once at the beginning of a YAML file, `task`, which can appear multiple times and `jobs`, which can also be repeated.


# Comments

Lines that begin with # are considered comments and are being ignored by the YALM parser, which is not a Semaphore 2.0 feature but the way YAML files work.


# The preamble
Each Semaphore 2.0 pipeline configuration file has a preamble, which is
mandatory and should be present on every `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file you create.


## Constants

### The e1-standard-2 constant

The `e1-standard-2` value used in the preamble represents the hardware of the Virtual Machine used for each job in the current pipeline and is a global variable.


### The ubuntu1804 constant

The `ubuntu1804` value used in the preamble represents the Operating System of the Virtual Machine used for each job in the current pipeline and is a global variable.



# List of Preamble Properties



## version

The `version` property is a string value that shows the version of the
pipeline YAML file that will be used.

List of valid values: `"v1.0"`

Example: `version: "v1.0"`

## name

The `name` property is a Unicode string that assigns a name to the Semaphore 2.0 project.

*Caution*: The `name` property can be found in other sections because it is used
for defining the name of a job inside a `jobs` block or the name of
a `task` section defined using `task`.

Example: `name: "The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project"`


## agent

The `agent` property requires three additional properties that identify the
environment (type of container) in which the jobs of the pipeline will get executed.

Example:

    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:


### machine

The `machine` property, which can only be found under `agent`, holds the `type` and `os_image` properties.

Example:

    machine:
      type: e1-standard-2
      os_image: ubuntu1804


### type

The `type` property is intended for selecting the machine
(hardware) you would like to use for your builds.

List of valid values: `e1-standard-2`

Example: `type = e1-standard-2`


### os_image

The `os_image` property specifies the operating system and the version of the operation systems that will be used.


Valid values: `ubuntu1804`


Example: `os_image = ubuntu1804`



## Preamble example

    version: "v1.0"
    name: "The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project"
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:


# Blocks

The `blocks` property is an array of items that hold the elements of a `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file.


## List of Blocks Properties

The values of the `blocks` property are the tasks of a pipeline as defined by the `task` property.

If you accidentally name two or more `blocks` items with the same name, you will get an error message similar to the following:

> semaphore.yml ERROR:
> Error: "There are at least two blocks with same name: Build Go project"


## Example of Blocks




# Task



## List of Task Properties



### jobs


### secrets


### prologue

As the `prologue` block is executed before a job, the result of the job that follows that `prologue` block has no effect on the execution of the `prologue` block.


### epilogue

`epilogue` blocks are executed even if the pipeline jobs that precede them have failed.


### env_vars

The elements of an `env_vars` array are name and value pairs that hold the name of the environment variable
and the value of the environment variable, respectively.


#### Example of env_vars


    env_vars:
      - name: VAR1
         value: Environment Variable 1
      - name: PI
         value: "3.14159"


The preceding YAML code exempt defines two environment variables named `VAR1` and `PI`. Both environment variables have string values, which means that numeric values that are not natural numbers need to be included in double quotes.


## Example of task





The indentation level of `prologue`, `epilogue` and `jobs` properties should be the same.



# Jobs


## List of Jobs Properties



### name


### commands



#### The checkout command

The `checkout` command is a special command offered by Semaphore 2.0 and is used for fetching the files of the GitHub repository into the virtual machine in order to be able to use them.


### cmd_file

the value of the `cmd_file` property is a string that points to a plain text file that can be found in the GitHub repository of your Semaphore 2.0 project.

Semaphore 2.0 reads the plain text file indicated by `cmd_file` and creates the equivalent job using a `commands` block, which is what is finally executed. This means that the `cmd_file` property is replaced before the job is started and a virtual machine begins its execution.

Notice that you cannot use both `commands` and `cmd_file` when defining a job.


#### Example of a cmd_file block


    jobs:
      - name: A name for this job
         cmd_file: GitHub/file/plain_text_file


### 


## Example of Jobs


The general structure of a job when using the `commands` property is as follows:

    jobs:
       - name: A name for this job
          commands:
             - Command 1
             - Command 2


The general structure of a job when using the `cmd_file` property is as follows:

    jobs:    
      - name: A name for this job
         cmd_file: path/to/file/plain_text_file



# Prologue and Epilogue


A `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` configuration file can have a single `prologue` and a single `epilogue` property per `task` property. Both `prologue` and `epilogue` properties are optional.


## The Prologue property

A `prologue` block is used when you want to execute some commands prior to a job. This is usually the case with initialization commands that install software, start or stop a service, etc.


## Example of prologue


## The Epilogue property


An `epilogue` block should be used when you want to execute some commands after a job has finished, either successfully or unsuccessfully.


## Example of epilogue



# The secrets property


# List of secrets properties



## Example of secrets



Note that the environment variable defined in a `secrets` property are used like regular environment variables defined in a `env_vars` block.

##  A complete .semaphore/semaphore.yml example

The following code presents a complete `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file:

    version: "v1.0"
    name: YAML file example for Go project.
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:
     - name: Inspect Linux environment
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Execute hw.go
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
                - echo $HOME
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR
                - pwd
                - ls -al
                - cat hw.go
                - echo $VAR1
                - echo $PI
          prologue:
              commands:
                - checkout
          env_vars:
               - name: VAR1
                 value: Environment Variable 1
               - name: PI
                 value: "3.14159"

     - name: Calling text file
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Using command_file
              cmd_file: command_file
          prologue:
              commands:
                - checkout

     - name: Build Go project
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Build hw.go
              commands:
                - checkout
                - sudo apt-get -y install golang-go
                - go build hw.go
                - ls -l ./hw
                - file ./hw
                - ./hw
            - name: PATH variable
              commands:
                - echo $PATH
          epilogue:
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_JOB_RESULT
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID


## A .semaphore/semaphore.yml file that uses secrets



## A .semaphore/semaphore.yml file without name properties

Although it is allowed to have `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` files without
name properties, it is considered a very bad practice and should be
avoided.

However, the following sample `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file proves
that it can be done:

    version: "v1.0"
    name: Basic YAML configuration file example.
    semaphore_image: standard
    blocks:
      - task:
          jobs:
              - commands:
                 - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
                 - echo "Hello World!"
